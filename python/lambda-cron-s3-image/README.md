# Lambda-Cron-S3-Image

This example creates:
- an S3 bucket
- a Cloudwatch namespace
- a lambda function that executes a cron scheduled event to download an image and upload it to the bucket
- associated IAM

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your Python files and your CloudFormation template.

Install the latest version of the AWS CDK CLI:

```shell
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
```

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
